# LogfileBackup
This software will rename the production neverwinter nights log file, when a system crash or reset happens. It will rename the log file to the formate
logfile 2021-10-31 0422    ! This will mean the 31st of October at 4:22 in the morning. This way all logfiles will have unique naming.

The system uses the configuration file to read the target directories for the service.

Note: we are no longer making any updates to this software. All of the functionality is being moved into a new application that has more features to meet our needs. Features of the new software called BoB Managera, include, rotating nwn log files to an archive directory, moving game server manager logfiles to an archive diretory, deleting characters players no longer want from their servervault, setting current server time so we can better warn players when the server will reboot.
